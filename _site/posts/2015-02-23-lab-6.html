<h1 id="lab-submission-instructions">Lab Submission instructions</h1>
<p>Checkout your subversion directory:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">svn</span> co https://phoenixforge.cs.uchicago.edu/svn/cnetid-cs162-win-15</code></pre>
<p>and create a directory for Lab 6</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">cd</span> cnetid-cs162-win-15
<span class="kw">mkdir</span> lab6
<span class="kw">svn</span> add lab6     <span class="co"># make it a working copy</span>
<span class="kw">cd</span> lab6
<span class="kw">touch</span> README     <span class="co"># README is now a working copy</span>
<span class="kw">svn</span> add README</code></pre>
<p>and then you can start working.</p>
<p>You get two 24-hour lab extensions this quarter, email me: [my last name] <code>at</code> cs <code>dot</code> uchicago <code>dot</code> edu for them. Make sure that you run</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">svn</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;update&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>frequently as you work on the lab so that you will definitely have a submission come the midnight deadline. Late submissions are not accepted: the time-stamp counts. Ensure that your lab code runs on the school machines. If you are having difficulty working with the lab machines then see me during office hours before the deadline.</p>
<p>Please ensure that each lab submission is in a distinct folder. For instance, for this lab the path to the lab subdirectory should be:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">cnetid-cs162-win-15/lab6</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-readme-file">The README file</h2>
<p>The <code>README</code> should contain commands for how to run your program on the school linux machines. Since you are building your code with <code>make</code> this means typing <code>make</code> should just work. In the event that you canâ€™t get that to work include the desired command in the README file. Ensure that your code runs on the machines that is a minimal requirement to receive a non-zero grade in the lab assignment. This should contain your name, a list of files you are submitting, and at least a sentence or two about each file.</p>
<p>Additionally make sure to add comments to your code explaining each of the procedures you use.</p>
