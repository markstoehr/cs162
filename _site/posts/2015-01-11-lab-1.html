<h1 id="lab-submission-instructions">Lab Submission instructions</h1>
<p>Checkout your subversion directory:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">svn</span> co https://phoenixforge.cs.uchicago.edu/svn/cnetid-cs162-win-15</code></pre>
<p>and create a directory for Lab 1</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">cd</span> cnetid-cs162-win-15
<span class="kw">mkdir</span> lab1
<span class="kw">svn</span> add lab1     <span class="co"># make it a working copy</span>
<span class="kw">cd</span> lab1
<span class="kw">touch</span> README     <span class="co"># README is now a working copy</span>
<span class="kw">svn</span> add README</code></pre>
<p>and then you can start working.</p>
<p>You get two 24-hour lab extensions this quarter, email me: [my last name] <code>at</code> cs <code>dot</code> uchicago <code>dot</code> edu for them. Make sure that you run</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">svn</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;update&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>frequently as you work on the lab so that you will definitely have a submission come the midnight deadline. Late submissions are not accepted: the time-stamp counts.</p>
<h2 id="writing-and-running-shell-scripts">Writing and running shell scripts</h2>
<p>A good resource is the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html">Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide</a>/</p>
<p>In class you have now had some exposure to bash commands. In this lab we will present you with several problems to solve using bash scripts to get you comfortable working in bash. These scripts should all have a preamble to help make them more useful. The main exercise today will get you working with <code>bash</code> arrays and string processing utilities.</p>
<p>Bash scripting is about constructing your own commands that can be used on your system. For example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cat</span> <span class="kw">&gt;</span> qed_echo.sh
<span class="co">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="kw">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;Quod erat demonstrandum!&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>You can turn it into an executable script by changing the permissions:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">chmod</span> +x qed_echo.sh</code></pre>
<p>and then you can run it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">./qed_echo.sh</span></code></pre>
<p>(Ungraded exercise before moving on: why do you have an <code>./</code> prepended to the name?)</p>
<p>You can also add it to your path:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">export</span> <span class="ot">PATH=${PATH}</span>:<span class="kw">`pwd`</span></code></pre>
<p>and then you can run it</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">qed_echo.sh</span></code></pre>
<p>Commands can be “permanently” added to your <code>$PATH</code> environment variable by running a command similar to <code>export PATH=${PATH}:</code>pwd`<code>each time you start  up a terminal.  My preference is to make a folder</code><span class="math">$HOME/bin` that contains my scripts I want to just be able to run and I have the following line in my `$</span>HOME/.bashrc` file:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">export</span> <span class="ot">PATH=${PATH}</span>:<span class="ot">${HOME}</span>/bin</code></pre>
<p>To make the script nice its good practice to include a header with an informative description:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="co">#</span>
<span class="co">#  qed_echo.sh</span>
<span class="co">#  Mark Stoehr, 2015</span>
<span class="co">#  </span>
<span class="co">#  Display QED.</span>
<span class="co">#</span></code></pre>
<p>Scripts can also easily take command arguments. So the script above can be modified to take an argument by writing:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;Quod erat demonstrandum, </span><span class="ot">$1</span><span class="st">!&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>Although what happens if we don’t include an argument? We want the script to gracefully handle that case so we include a conditional</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">if [[</span> <span class="ot">$#</span> <span class="ot">-eq</span>  0<span class="kw"> ]]</span>; <span class="kw">then</span>
    <span class="kw">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;Quod erat demonstrandum!&quot;</span>
<span class="kw">else</span>
    <span class="kw">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;Quod erat demonstrandum, </span><span class="ot">$1</span><span class="st">!&quot;</span>
<span class="kw">fi</span></code></pre>
<p>Sometimes in <code>bash</code> we wish to perform a <code>map</code>-like operation over a “subtree” of the file system (remember the file system is not exactly a tree). This can be done by carefully studying what <code>ls</code> does and using bash control structures. There are other approaches including recursion (although that can lead to a “segfault” if there are too many levels to the recursion). Google is your friend for <code>bash</code> utilities. This leads to exercise 1:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Write a bash script that takes two arguments: a command and a file. If the file is a regular file then it should run the command and pass the file as an argument. If the file is a directory then the command should be applied to all regular files in the subtree rooted at the directory. Call the script <code>fsmap.sh</code>.</strong> (Warning this is not safe or good practice for an actual shell script but its informative for you to learn how to do it).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write a script <code>list_contents.sh</code> that uses <code>fsmap.sh</code> to report the number of lines and words for all files within a subtree of the file system.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Another natural operation is a file system <code>fold</code> operation. You will find it useful to understand arithmetic expressions built from syntax like: <code>$(( ))</code> in <code>bash</code>:</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Write a script <code>fs_additive_fold.sh</code> that takes a command and a file as input. It shall recurse over the subtree that has the file as root (which will be a single file if the file is not a directory or link). The command is assumed to take a single file as input and output a number. For every regular file in the subtree rooted at the input file, get the numbers they output and add them.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write a script <code>disk_usage.sh</code> which takes a file as input and outputs the total number of kilobytes used by that file or directory using <code>fs_additive_fold.sh</code>. Compare its output to what you get with <code>du</code> (and the correct flags: read the <code>man</code> page). Use <code>time</code> to profile their execution speeds on a system of directories (say your home directory on the lab machine) and put the outputs of <code>time</code> into your lab writeup <code>README</code> file included in your submission.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>One issue with the above files is that they might run into problems due to symbolic links: see the command <code>ln</code>.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>In the <code>README</code> file describe the problem that symbolic links can create. Make a small set of directories and other files that breaks the above scripts. Describe the directories you created in the <code>README</code> file. Use <code>find</code> to detect the problem and adjust the your scripts to include the check and give an informative error message should a directory fail the check. Save these new scripts with a <code>_check</code> suffix to indicate the update. Profile the performance of these scripts compared to the previous ones and report the performance in your <code>README</code> file.</strong></li>
</ol>
