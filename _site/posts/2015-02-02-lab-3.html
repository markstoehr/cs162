<h1 id="dancing-sparse-matrices-via-circular-linked-lists">Dancing Sparse Matrices Via Circular Linked Lists</h1>
<p>You have begun to get your feet wet with C. This lab will extend some of the thinking you have encountered in class. I have remarked in lab that linked lists can cause a program to slow down because of cache-misses. This lab focuses on a specific use case for linked lists where they are very useful. You are going to build sparse matrices that dance with circular linked lists.</p>
<p>To provide some context for what we are achieving in this lab it is useful to think about data structures in general. A data structure is represented using words which are a set of finite sequences of bits and each word has an address. Operations on data structures correspond to manipulating these words. The content of the words (the bits) determine the data structure’s state. An instance of a data structure is a set of words on a physical machine. The most basic operations for a data structure are</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a new instance of the object</li>
<li>Test whether two data structures are the same</li>
<li>Destroy the object and free the memory</li>
</ol>
<p>To define these operations we need to understand the data structure we are working with abstractly.</p>
<p>As a note, the interfaces we write for performing operations to list or matrix set will often contain pointers. This is a good convention because it allows a natural method for error-checking where if the operation fails you may return a null pointer. Then</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">if</span> (!(Output)) {
   printf(<span class="st">&quot;Error</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>);
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="an-entrée">An Entrée</h2>
<p>I take this completely from <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047v1.pdf">Knuth</a>. Before we jet into the main course we must first understand linked lists. We first consider the doubly linked circular list (DLCL). Such a linked list has a handle which we define as <code>struct List</code>. The elements in the list are instances of <code>struct ListNode</code>. Each list will contain an element <code>head</code> that serves as the “front” of a list and makes implementation much easier. The analogous element in Haskell is <code>[]</code>. We do not treat the <code>value</code> field of <code>head</code> as special. The trivial DLCL has only <code>head</code> and is considered empty so <code>list-&gt;count == 0</code> in that case. A non-empty list has other instances <code>ListNode</code> which hold the data and has non-zero count. In this lab we are more interested in the linking structure so the data we consider is simply <code>int</code>, although such lists are used for modeling more generic data as well.</p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">
<span class="kw">struct</span> ListNode;
<span class="kw">struct</span> List;

<span class="kw">typedef</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> ListNode {
    <span class="dt">int</span> value;
    <span class="kw">struct</span> ListNode *succ;
    <span class="kw">struct</span> ListNode *prec;
    <span class="kw">struct</span> List *handle;
} ListNode;

<span class="kw">typedef</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> List {
    <span class="dt">int</span> count;
    ListNode *head;
} List;</code></pre>
<p>This code tells the <code>C</code> compiler how to layout the memory for a doubly linked list. Note the use of <code>typedef</code> so that I don’t have to write <code>struct</code> many times through the code. Once you have these declarations <code>C</code> knows how to set the bits in memory, access their values, and interpret them. This code by itself is not very useful, however. We need to have some basic operations</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement a list constructor function. Call it <code>List_create</code> and it should return a pointer to a list <code>List *</code> that is newly allocated. (You will need to do use exercise 3 here). Check for failures or if there are invariants that have been violated. A list should always have a <code>head</code> and each node in a list should have a <code>succ</code> and <code>prec</code> field that have a meaningful (non-NULL) reference. If these can’t be preserved then return a <code>NULL</code>. You will need to allocate memory to the <code>head</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re done processing a list it is good practice to cleanup memory (not doing so leads to memory leaks!) so</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement a destructor function. Call it <code>List_destroy</code> that frees the memory used by the list back up. The input should just be a pointer to a list <code>List *</code> and the list is possibly non-empty (i.e. may have some <code>ListNodes</code> in it). Avoid memory leaks by removing all internal <code>ListNodes</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lists are a compound type and we also need constructors and destructors for <code>ListNode</code>. Note that the instances of <code>ListNode</code> contained in a list (e.g. the <code>head</code> or any other element) should always have a defined <code>succ</code> and <code>prec</code> field.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement a <code>ListNode_create</code> and <code>ListNode_destroy</code>. Again, if there is some problem return <code>NULL</code>. Nodes should always have some reference to a list either through the <code>handle</code> pointer or via the <code>handle</code> points of their <code>prec</code> and <code>succ</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instances of <code>ListNode</code> are only interesting when they are part of a list and should generally not be used independent of a given list.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a function <code>List *ListPush(ListNode *x, ListNode *succ)</code> which takes a node and pushes it onto a list given its successor in that list. The implementation should be quite simple. The return pointer can be <code>NULL</code> in the case of a failure but otherwise return a pointer to the <code>List *</code> handle to indicate success. An analogous function can be written <code>List *ListPushValue(int value, ListNode *succ)</code>. We can also write removal functions <code>List *ListPop(ListNode *x)</code> where the <code>List *</code> is either the <code>List</code> instance that no longer has <code>ListNode *x</code> or a <code>NULL</code> pointer to indicate failure. Keep in mind <code>head</code> should always be present in the list and its value does not matter (and should not be used).<br /><code>head</code> is analogous to <code>[]</code> in Haskell and the list handle <code>List</code> is the name assigned to the list in Haskell. <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> operations should not operate on <code>head</code> (think of this like a type annotation on the physical hardware). All of these functions return pointers, make sure that if they are called on an ill-formed <code>List</code> or if they can’t be completed without violating one of the invariants then return <code>NULL</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>ListPop</code> function deserves further comment. Linked lists are strongest when traversals of the list are rare relative to inserations and deletions to the list. So, when we implement a linked list we are often intending to reinsert elements that have been removed. Therefore, it does not make sense to free memory from everything that gets popped since we may want to put the element back in the list, observe that doing so is quite easy (it should be quite similar to the list remove code):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">(x-&gt;succ)-&gt;prec = x;
(x-&gt;prec)-&gt;succ = x;</code></pre>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement <code>ListReinsert</code> which reinserts a <code>ListNode</code> into the list. By the same token we also want a function <code>ListPopDestroy</code> that will pop an element and destroy the node.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, just to ensure that we can work with these <code>List</code> instances in a particular way we also need to be able to check equality.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement Equality Testing. Two instances of <code>List</code> are equal if they have the same number of nodes and the nodes are in one-to-one correspondence with each other respecting the link structure and node values.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="knuths-toroidal-sparse-matrix-representation">Knuth’s Toroidal Sparse Matrix Representation</h2>
<p>We are going to implement a sparse matrix representation using DLCLs. The representation in graphic form is <img src="../images/Knuth-figure-3.png" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" title="Pacman Matrix." /></p>
<p>You may think of a toroidal matrix representation as a Pacman game field (minus the ghosts and barriers), each matrix cell is connected to its four neighbors: matrix cells on the boundary wrap around to the other side. We will make this precise. Let <span class="math"><em>A</em> ∈ {0, 1}<sup><em>n</em> × <em>m</em></sup></span> be a Boolean <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> by <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> matrix (so <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> rows and <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> columns). We assume that most of the entries of the matrix are zeros (i.e. we assume the matrix is sparse) so rather than explicitly storing the matrix in an array we instead only store the non-zero elements. We further assume that the matrix is binary so that the non-zero entries need only store their positions and do not need to store any magnitude information.</p>
<p>Using our model of DLCLs as a model template the next exercises involve constructing a column-based toroidal matrix representation. Each non-zero entry of the matrix is a <code>struct MatrixNode</code> and these have six fields <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>value</code>, and <code>column</code>. <strong>The pointers <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>up</code>, and <code>down</code> should always refer to a <code>struct MatrixNode</code> instance. A key invariant is that they should not refer to <code>NULL</code>.</strong> The <code>column</code> field will refer to a handle for the column.</p>
<p>The <span class="math"><em>n</em> × <em>m</em></span> possible entries in a matrix are</p>
<center>
<br /><span class="math">$$\begin{bmatrix} A_{1,1} &amp; A_{1,2}  &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1,m}\\
                        A_{2,1} &amp; A_{2,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{2,m}\\
                        \vdots  &amp; \vdots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
                        A_{n,1} &amp; A_{n,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{n,m}   \end{bmatrix} $$</span><br />
</center>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a declaration for <code>MatrixNode</code> mirroring the <code>ListNode</code> declaration given above.</li>
</ol>
<p>The representation we pick is that the columns of <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> are DLCLs so that column <span class="math"><em>j</em></span> is denoted by <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span> and the non-zero entries of <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span> are represented with <code>struct MatrixNode</code> instances. Our representation of the DLCL column also needs a <code>head</code> node as well as a handle. We may think of <code>head</code> as being an element <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub>0, <em>j</em></sub></span> which does not represent an entry of the matrix but is used to make insertion and deletion from a column convenient. The <code>MatrixNode</code> instances in a column can be sorted from top to bottom as they appear in the matrix. The <code>up</code> field of a <code>MatrixNode</code> should point to the non-zero entry immediately above it, the top entry should point to <code>head</code>, and the <code>up</code> field of <code>head</code> should wrap around and point to the bottom element. Similarly, the down element should point to the next element of the list. The <code>down</code> field of <code>head</code> should point to the top element, and the <code>down</code> field of the bottom element should point to <code>head</code> (once again wrapping around–consult the diagram at the top).</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement <code>MatrixNode_create</code> and <code>MatrixNode_destroy</code>. Since we do not have the handle yet do not worry about the topology for the moment these are just for the data objects themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make this data structure useful, though, we need a handle. This handle is declared as a <code>struct MatrixColumn</code> which has fields <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>root</code>. <code>name</code> is used for printing and should be a <code>char</code> (since we don’t expect many columns in our matrix), <code>size</code> should represent the number of nodes in the list. For the moment we defer the discussion of <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> but they will point to adjacent columns. <code>root</code> is a pointer to the matrix handle.</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement <code>MatrixColumn_create</code>, <code>MatrixColumn_destroy</code> (for the create constructor think about what the <code>size</code> field should be and whether any nodes should be created). Again return <code>NULL</code> if something goes wrong. A matrix column instance will have a <code>MatrixNode</code> for each non-zero element as well as one representing the <code>head</code> of the column.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, further operations on the column cannot be considered until we define the relationship between separate columns. To work with the columns we declare a <code>struct Matrix</code> which will serve as a handle for the whole matrix. <code>Matrix</code> should have fields <code>height</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>head_column</code> (whose functionality should be predictable at this point). Like the columns it is a DLCL but over <code>MatrixColumn</code> instances.</p>
<ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement <code>Matrix_create</code> and <code>Matrix_destroy</code>. Again return <code>NULL</code> if something goes wrong (e.g. if some invariant that should hold for DLCLs is violated).</li>
</ol>
<p>To get a basic feel for how <code>Matrix</code> works it is useful to implement a constructor for simple matrices. Note that when constructing matrices there will be adjacent non-empty columns and the <code>MatrixNode</code>s in those columns should use the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> fields: i.e. for each non-empty row we can think of the elements as being arranged in a ring. In the case of an identity matrix each row has only a single element:</p>
<center>
<br /><span class="math">$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;   &amp;  &amp;  \\
                         &amp; 1 &amp;  &amp; \\
                          &amp;   &amp; \ddots &amp;  \\
                         &amp;  &amp;  &amp; 1   \end{bmatrix} $$</span><br />
</center>
<p>so the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> fields should loop back onto themselves. In the matrix below</p>
<center>
<br /><span class="math">$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1  &amp;  &amp; 1 \\
                         &amp; 1 &amp;  &amp; 1 \\
                          &amp; 1  &amp;  &amp;  \\
                         1 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; 1   \end{bmatrix} $$</span><br />
</center>
<p><span class="math">(<em>A</em><sub>1, 1</sub>) <code>−</code>  <code>&gt;</code> <code>l</code><code>e</code><code>f</code><code>t</code></span> points to <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub>1, 4</sub></span> and <span class="math">(<em>A</em><sub>1, 1</sub>) <code>−</code>  <code>&gt;</code> <code>r</code><code>i</code><code>g</code><code>h</code><code>t</code></span> points to <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub>1, 2</sub></span>. Element <span class="math"><em>A</em><sub>3, 2</sub></span> has <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> fields that wrap around to itself. The <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> fields are as you would expect.</p>
<ol start="10" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement a function <code>Matrix_simple_example</code> that creates the <span class="math">4 × 4</span> matrix above, be sure to properly capture the topology and the various data fields we have been discussing. The column names should start with <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> and have the same naming scheme as excel columns. Implement a function <code>Matrix_identity(int n)</code> which returns a new matrix that is the identity matrix of dimension <code>n</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have some simple matrices to play with we can write the most important debugging tool:</p>
<ol start="11" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement a function <code>Matrix_print</code> that display a matrix, be sure to make the formatting nice: display the column names and print the zeros and ones that appear in the matrix.</li>
</ol>
<p>You also may have noticed something. In exercise 10 we encounter a matrix that does not have a unique representation. Keeping that in mind implement an equality testing function:</p>
<ol start="12" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement <code>Matrix_equal</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="generating-random-numbers">Generating Random Numbers</h2>
<p>To get a sense of matrices it will be useful to be able to generate random matrices. The goal here is not to delve too deeply into random number generation but suffice to say that all we have are pseudo-random number generators and these are not perfect random integers so some care has to be taken to generate random numbers within a specified range. The pseduorandom number generator generates a number in the range <code>[0,RAND_MAX]</code> inclusive so if I want to generate a number in the range <code>[0,n]</code> one simple algorithm</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="co">// print_rand.c -- print a random number within a range</span>
<span class="co">// clang -g -Wall -o test_rand test_rand.c</span>
<span class="ot">#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>
<span class="ot">#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>
<span class="ot">#include&lt;time.h&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">int</span> main() {
    <span class="dt">long</span> max_val;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;Please type the maximum value in the range you wish to generate: &quot;</span>);
    scanf(<span class="st">&quot;%l&quot;</span>, &amp;max_val);
    
    <span class="dt">long</span> number;
    
    srand ( time(NULL));  <span class="co">// seed the random number generator</span>
    
    <span class="kw">do</span> {
        number = rand();
    } <span class="kw">while</span> ( number &gt; max_val);
 
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;%l</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>,number);
}</code></pre>
<p>This works because each number in the range <code>[0,n]</code> has roughly equal probability so if I only take numbers in that range then I end up with equal chances on all those numbers. A problem occurs if <code>n</code> is much less than <code>RAND_MAX</code> because that while loop could take far too long to actually generate a number. So what we do is divide <code>RAND_MAX</code> into blocks of size <code>n</code> and leave off the remainder:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="co">// print_rand.c -- print a random number within a range</span>
<span class="co">// clang -g -Wall -o test_rand test_rand.c</span>

        number = rand();
    } <span class="kw">while</span> ( number &gt; max_bound);
    
    number %= max_val;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;%d</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>,number);
}</code></pre>
<p>The code <code>RAND_MAX/max_val * max_val</code> note that integer division works by truncation so <code>0/3 == 0</code>, <code>1/3 == 0</code>, <code>2/3 == 0</code>, <code>3/3 == 1</code>, <code>4/3 == 1</code>, etc. so that if</p>

<br /><span class="math"><em>a</em> = <em>q</em><em>b</em> + <em>r</em></span><br />
</center>
<p>where <span class="math">0 ≤ <em>r</em> &lt; |<em>b</em>|</span> then in C <code>a/b = q</code> and <code>a % b = r</code>. We can then test how long it takes to generate a given number using the <code>clock()</code> command and the <code>CLOCKS_PER_SEC</code> macro. Here <code>clock_t</code> is a type that represents the number of clock ticks.</p>

<p>Given that you can generate a random number you can now generate random subsets of a desired size. The trick is to think about the bits of the number you generate (i.e. think about how many C integers you could be generating less than 32 and what that says about sets of size 5). <code>x &amp; 1</code> tests if the last bit of <code>x</code> is one and <code>x &gt;&gt; 1</code> or <code>x/2</code> shifts the bits of <code>x</code> to the right so that the least significant bit is lopped off: e.g. <code>10011 &gt;&gt; 1 == 1001</code>. With random sets you are now able to generate random matrices. Each column of the matrix is simply a random set of entries</p>
<ol start="13" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Implement <code>Matrix_random(int n)</code> which creates a new matrix instance that has columns drawn randomly from the set <code>['A','A'+n-1]</code> (e.g. if <code>n==2</code> then <code>['A','B']</code> since <code>'A'+2-1 == 'B'</code>). For each of the non-zero columns draw a random subset of elements for the non-zero rows. Implement a program that takes an integer <code>n</code> and prints a random boolean matrix.</li>

<p>Now we turn our matrix representation into a monoid. I.e. we are going to endow our matrix representation with some operations. We will use a different algebraic structure than you may have seen before. But, fundamentally, we are working with familiar matrix multiplication.</p>
<ol start="14" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Implement <code>Matrix_transpose</code> that makes the columns rows and the rows columns. Column <code>'A'</code> should be row <code>1</code>, column <code>'B'</code> should be row <code>2</code>, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement <code>Matrix_product</code> that takes two matrices and creates a new matrix with their product. The matrix product will be similar to the familiar one from high school however we make use of a different semi-ring operation, namely <code>( |, &amp; )</code> rather than <code>(+,*)</code>. That is if <span class="math"><em>C</em> = <em>A</em><em>B</em></span> then</p></li>
